# Game-Al--WInner-Prediction

# 1. Overview
PUBG is a battle-royale video game where 100 players battle on a game map by rummaging for weapons and tools and fighting until there is only one surviving player or team. Initially a Kaggle competition, the purpose of this project is to predict the final placement of a given player based off of game stats. This is an interesting project for our group because it is a game we all love to play. We hope that by applying the skills we learned this semester in CS 7641, we can learn the best way to maximize our chances of winning our future matches. So far, winning has been determined by starting randomly and employing different in-game tactics, but by doing this project, we can learn with ML how to win.

We feel that we can solve our problem by verifying that our data is valuable and are confident in the techniques we learned this semester to find that value. Instead of individually getting better at various in-game tactics, we hope to build a prediction engine that can tell us how likely a given tactic is to win so we can test out our ideas and focus on winning.

We aim to do this through the following steps:

Explore the data
Pre-process and engineer the features

# 2.Target:
winPlacePerc - The target of prediction. This is a percentile winning placement, where 1 corresponds to 1st place, and 0 corresponds to last place in the match.
